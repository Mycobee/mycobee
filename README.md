## Hello!

My name is Rob (he/him). I strive to light up the world and people's lives with computers. I am care deeply about privacy, freedom, equity, and the environment.

I plan to build this out more in the future, but for now, I build FOSS tools, work as an SRE at [Doximity, Inc.](https://github.com/doximity), help small organizations and non-profits get firm tech footing via [Ouzel Software](https://ouzelsoftware.com), climb mountains, and sing songs.

I enjoy Ruby, Linux, and kindness ‚ù§Ô∏è
