## Hello!

My name is Rob (he/him). I strive to light up the world and people's lives with computers. I am care deeply about privacy, freedom, equity, and the environment.

I plan to iron this README out more in the future. But for now...I build FOSS tools, work as an SRE at [Doximity, Inc.](https://github.com/doximity), help small organizations and non-profits succeed digitally via [Ouzel Software](https://ouzelsoftware.com), climb mountains, and sing songs.

I enjoy Ruby, Linux, and kindness ‚ù§Ô∏è

A few of open source projects I have contributed to:
- Whonix (`derivative-maker` automated build pipeline, `package-parser`, and Phabricator Migration)
- [PingPie](https://github.com/Mycobee/pingpie) (My tiny simple uptime monitoring tool for small projects, non-profits, and hobbyists)
- [debian-base](https://github.com/Mycobee/debian-base) (An ansible repository for configuring a debian VM with sane defaults and security in mind)
- Mattermost (Lifecycle component upgrades && Cypress tests)
